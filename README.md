# big-arrays-and-objects-generator
Generate Numbers or Strings to populate big Arrays or big Objects.

Since I like to test all those JS snippets, tricks to 'do stuff in a super efficient way' that we found all over the web, I always had to write and rewrite those few lines of code. Until now.

I use this with Quokka for VSCode so I don't need any browser to test those snippets.
